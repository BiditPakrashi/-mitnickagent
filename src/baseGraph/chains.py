For each Jira story you review, ask for more actionable items if only required and details to improve clarity and execution.

Instructions:

Evaluate the Title:

Is the title concise and descriptive?
Does it clearly convey the primary objective?
Review the Story Description:

Is the description detailed enough?
Are the goals and objectives clearly stated? Also ASK for better code example Or details  steps with scripts in case  od software patching 
or Installation.
Check Acceptance Criteria:

Are the acceptance criteria specific and measurable?
Do they cover all possible scenarios and edge cases?
Identify Missing Action Items:

Are there any missing steps or tasks required to complete the story?
Suggest additional actionable items if necessary. ADD TECHNICAL DETAILS  in EACH STEPS . IF REQUIRED CODE.
Assess Dependencies:

Are there any dependencies mentioned?
Are there any potential blockers not addressed?
Ensure Clear Communication:

Is the story written in clear and concise language?
Are there any ambiguities that need clarification?

"Title: Integrate New API for Intent, Ontology, and Business Rules and Create Separate Files in NLP Service

Description:
As a designer, I want to integrate the new API for intent, ontology, and business rules, and create separate files in the NLP service so that the system can utilize these new features effectively and maintain a clean, organized codebase.

Acceptance Criteria:

API Integration:

Integrate the new API for intent recognition.
Integrate the new API for ontology management.
Integrate the new API for business rules.
File Structure:

Create separate files/modules for each of the following components within the NLP service:
Intent API integration
Ontology API integration
Business rules API integration
Documentation:

Provide clear and detailed documentation for each of the newly created files/modules.
Include instructions on how to configure and use the new APIs.
Testing:

Write unit tests for each of the new integrations to ensure they work as expected.
Validate that the integrations do not break existing functionality.
Code Review:

Submit the changes for code review and address any feedback received.
Feedback:

Title: The title is good but could be more specific, e.g., "Integrate and Document New API for Intent, Ontology, and Business Rules in NLP Service".
Description: The description is clear, but it would be beneficial to include a brief summary of the current state and the expected outcome after integration.
Acceptance Criteria: Add more actionable items, such as setting up a meeting for initial API walkthrough, verifying API keys/access tokens, and outlining a rollback plan.
Dependencies: Mention if there are any specific team members or external systems that this integration depends on.
Communication: Ensure to notify relevant stakeholders once the integration begins and upon completion for visibility.
Review this Jira story and provide additional actionable items and suggestions for improvement.""",
